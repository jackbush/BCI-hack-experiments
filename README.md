## Terminal Printouts

A few Ruby scripts that connect to Neurosky's Thinkgear Connector and print the various parts of the output data to the terminal as a stream of JSON objects.

## Client Servers

Variety of Node.js servers written to be ran locally on the client's computer, collecting their EEG data and serving it through a websocket. Objective is to allow data to be picked up by the hosted website.

## Context

A component of my final project on Web Development Immersive course at General Assembly. Please see other Mindflow-prepended repos for the rest of the project.
